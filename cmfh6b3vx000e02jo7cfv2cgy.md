Most of the people have misunderstand that React is a framework. But React is a popular open-source component based JavaScript library, used for building user interfaces, especially for single page applications (SPAs). Frameworks have pre defined structure. So we have to stick those structure and we are in control. But libraries haven’t pre defined structure, we can decide the structure of applications. And we can use tools from library to build scalable applications.

React was developed by **Facebook** (now Meta) and released in **2013**. React helps developers create fast, dynamic, and interactive web applications with less code and better performance.

### How does React Work?

React use virtual DOM for faster updates. DOM stands for Document Object Model. It’s how your browser represent the webpage. It’s like tree-like structure that represents all the elements on a web page. \[headings,buttons etc…\] In traditional web development, whenever something on the page changes \[like button click or a form input\] the browser updates the actual DOM. Updating the real DOM can be slow, especially in large or complex applications.

So that React use ‘Virtual DOM’. It is lightweight copy of the real DOM stored in memory. When change occurs, React:

1. Updates the Virtual DOM
    
2. Compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to see what changed (this process is called “diffing”)
    
3. Makes only the necessary changes to the real DOM
    

This approach avoids unnecessary updates and improves the performance of the application.

And also React ensure better application control with one-way data binding. That means in React data flows in a single direction, from parent components to child components. This is called one-way data binding. A parent component passes data to a child component using props(short for ‘properties’). This child component receives this data but cannot modify it directly. If a change is needed, it must send a message back to the parent to update the data. This one-way flow makes the data easier to trace and debug, providing better control over how the application behaves.

### Key Features of React

1. Virtual DOM
    

React uses a **Virtual DOM** to optimize UI rendering. Instead of updating the entire real DOM directly, React:

* Creates a lightweight copy of the DOM (Virtual DOM).
    
* Compares it with the previous version to detect changes (diffing).
    
* Updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM (reconciliation), improving performance.
    

2. Component based Architecture
    

React follows a **component-based approach**, where the UI is broken down into reusable components. These components:

* Can be functional or class-based.
    
* It allows code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
    

3. JSX (JavaScript XML)
    

React uses [**JSX**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-jsx-introduction/), a syntax extension that allows developers to write **HTML** inside JavaScript. JSX makes the code:

* More readable and expressive.
    
* Easier to understand and debug.
    

4. One-Way Data Binding
    

React uses **one-way data binding**, meaning data flows in a single direction from parent components to child components via **props**. This provides better control over data and helps maintain predictable behavior.

5. State Management
    

React manages component state efficiently using the **useState hook** (for functional components) or this.state (for class components). State allows dynamic updates without reloading the page.

6. React Hooks
    

**Hooks** allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without needing class components. Common hooks include:

* **useState:** for managing local state.
    
* **useEffect:** for handling side effects like API calls.
    
* **useContext:** for global state management.
    

7. React Router
    

React provides React Router for managing navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). It enables dynamic routing without requiring full-page reloads.

**How it works**

* When you click the **Home** or **About** link, the URL changes (e.g., `/about`), but the browser **does not reload the page**.
    
* Instead, React Router **shows the correct component** (`Home` or `About`) dynamically.

## ReactJs Lifecycle

Every **React component** goes through a **lifecycle**, which is the **sequence of phases** it passes through from creation to removal from the DOM (webpage). React provides **built-in methods (also called lifecycle methods)** that get called automatically during these phases. These methods allow developers to:

* Initialize data (state/props)
    
* Fetch data or set up event listeners
    
* Update the UI efficiently
    
* Clean up before the component is destroyed
    

Understanding the lifecycle helps you write better, more optimized React code.

React is not a framework but a **flexible, powerful library** for building modern web applications. Its **Virtual DOM**, **component-based architecture**, **JSX**, **one-way data flow**, and **hooks** make it a popular choice for developers seeking performance, scalability, and maintainable code.
